# New York City data location analysis

Problem:
The problem clearly defined is where should a restaurant owner open his restaurant in new York ? This is a big question for restaurants owners because the location of a restaurant could make the difference between it being the place to go and a failure.
The right location for the restaurant would help it attract the right customers that can spread word about it’s food and how excellent the service was because a restaurant owner can do everything right but because of it’s location it could take a great hit. So in essence what I will try to do is I will try to find the best place for a restaurant to open in new York

Data & Approach:
To find the best place for a restaurant I would cluster neighborhoods according to their most trending venues using the FourSquare API and trend end point which shows which venues are trending near a certain location. This would show the cluster in which restaurants are trending and therefore that neighborhood is the most suitable for a restaurant to open
